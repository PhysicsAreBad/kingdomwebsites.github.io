		<p>The kingdom of Teachers Pets is one of the newest kingdoms that has been formed. Ruled by Princess Kaiya, it is also one of the most peaceful town and is welcome to anyone. Any living creature that steps foot into the kingdom is under the protection of the it by law. Even if there is a death sentence held over that person or thing, it is safe as long as it is in the kingdom and pleads mercy from the princess.</p>

	<div class="bio description">
		<p>Princess Kaiya’s origins are unknown. Even though she rules her own kingdom, she also rules a small town inside of the Kingdom of Books known as Book Nerds’ Gardens. She is also the heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Books. WARNING, it is highly advised against calling Princess Kaiya as Queen Kaiya, especially if you are pleading mercy! Princess Kaiya will take it as an offense and will either kick you out of the kingdom, imprison you, or sentence you to death. She will get very defensive if anyone does this. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!! When she isn’t feeling threatened, her demeanor is closer to that of a young child on a sugar high then the ruler of a kingdom, though her entire demeanor will shift if an important matter is at hand, she feels threatened, or anyone is purposefully injured in the kingdom borders. ANOTHER WARNING, if any harm comes to a River Otter in the borders of her kingdom, the Princess will track down whoever did it by any means necessary (River Otters = Princess’s Spirit Animal).</p>
