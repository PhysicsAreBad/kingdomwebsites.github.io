		<p>Queen Olivia was born in the Kingdom of Books, in the village of Book Nerds’ Garden. During her life, she was able to rise up and become the Queen of Weebs. She is close allies with the Kingdom of Books, and often visits her hometown, and the rest of the kingdom. She also allies with all the other kingdoms, even if she often gets really annoyed at Lord Jess III, sometimes placing threats on his life. Very few have seen her face, and even less have been in her presence. There are no photographs of her and very few semi-accurate paintings. Many of the painting of her are all artist renditions, based on the facts that they know. Queen Olivia’s favorite animal is the sea otter, explaining the Kingdom’s location near the coast. All sea otters are under her protection. Together, Queen Olivia and Princess Kaiya form the Otter Protection Agency. Her Majesty's favorite foods are Sprite, Skittles, Cup Noodle, and dark chocolate. She is also well trained in all types of combat. Queen Olivia has trained with many assassins, including the Silent Assassins of the Red Desert, and Arobynn Hamel, the King of the Northern Erailean Assassins. She has also trained with various fae to hone her small ounce of fae power, including Aelin Ashyrver Galyanthis, Rowan Whitehorn, and the inner circle of the Night Court. (WIP)</p>
