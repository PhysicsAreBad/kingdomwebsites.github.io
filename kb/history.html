	<div id="history"> <p>The origins of princess Kaiya, heir to the kingdom of books, is unknown to the nerdy world. How she came to be the heir of the kingdom of Books and rule her very own kingdom is a question that no one besides a select few hold the answer to. For the record, however, even though she has her own kingdom, she is known as a princess due to her playful and hyper demeanor.
