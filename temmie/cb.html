	<div id="bio"><p> Queen Temmie III was born in the Temmie Village, which at that  time was one of the last surviving villages from the genocide of the first Frisk. She was already the daughter of the chief at that time. When her father dusted by poison, she inherited the role. She led her kingdom to prosperity by the invention of the awed Temmie Armor and the appetizing Temmie Flakes. Now her kingdom is one of the happiest known with the strongest army containing demonic Temmie soldiers wearing Temmie Armour. Many know of her and has seen her during many parades, watching from the balcony. Some have met her, and proclaim that she is very kind. She is very powerful, having an exceptional skill in daggers, reflexes, detecting and stopping spells. She is great friends with the rulers of the other kingdoms. She does most trade and diplomacy with Imperial Spam Empire. Although she has to remind their generals and committees about false war alarms.</p>
