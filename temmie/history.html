	<div id="history">The Temmie kingdom started as a small village hidden behind a hard to cross waterfall. The Temmies are theorized to once have fish tails a long time ago. The Temmies lived in relative secrecy. That was until the first Chara came. They first seemed a very adorable child, but then they killed half of the Temmie population for the ExP. After that, the Temmie lived in poverty for a while until Queen Temmie III, who forged the Temmie Armor with Waterfall Metal and mystical Arcane Temmie Magic. A fellow temmie and business tem named Bob. Together they made the Temmie flakes, a breakfast cereal that cures all illnesses while giving the eater enhanced strength and adrenaline for the day. Soon after that, many wanted to buy their products, which led them to their well known prosperity. Temmies now enjoy a luxurious life while receiving hundreds of tourists. The army are well skilled people split into Assassins, Warriors, and Mages.
